-- PhishingSense RLS Policy Quick Fix
-- Copy and paste this into Supabase SQL Editor
-- Run this if you're getting 42501 errors (RLS policy violations)

-- Enable RLS on users table
ALTER TABLE public.users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop existing policies (if any)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own profile" ON public.users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own profile" ON public.users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own profile" ON public.users;

-- Create the required RLS policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own profile" ON public.users
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own profile" ON public.users
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own profile" ON public.users
    FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- Also fix user_settings table policies
ALTER TABLE public.user_settings ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own settings" ON public.user_settings;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own settings" ON public.user_settings;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own settings" ON public.user_settings;

CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own settings" ON public.user_settings
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own settings" ON public.user_settings
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own settings" ON public.user_settings
    FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Verify policies are working
SELECT
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    policyname,
    cmd,
    qual,
    with_check
FROM pg_policies
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
